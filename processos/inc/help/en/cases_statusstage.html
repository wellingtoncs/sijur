  <h3><a name="SECTION03142000000000000000" id="SECTION03142000000000000000"></a>New case status</h3>

  <p><b>In order to change the status of a case</b>, follow the steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to the general information tab of the case.</li>

    <li>Select new status of the case from the &#8220;Status&#8221; dropdown menu. Depending on the current status of the case, you have some of the following possibilities:

      <ul>
        <li>draft</li>

        <li>open</li>

        <li>closed</li>

        <li>merged</li>

        <li>suspended</li>

        <li>deleted (in reality, a case registered in the system is never deleted, but it is &#8220;marked&#8221; as such and only system administrators can access it. If necessary, the administrator of the system can restore the case on a later stage.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>NB!</b> By marking the case as &#8220;closed&#8221; makes the user unable to modify the data in it. Only the administrator is able to change the status of the case again, so that editing and additional modifications are done with regards to this particular case.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click on the &#8220;Validate&#8221; button, which appears right after the dropdown menu after selecting a new value.</li>

    <li>Clicking the &#8220;Validate&#8221; button leads to opening of another form called: &#8220;Case status change&#8221;. The status change will not be processed unless this form is completed. The form contains the following fields:

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Start</strong></dt>

        <dd>The date and the hour from which on the status of the case has been changed</dd>

        <dt><strong>Time spent on activity</strong></dt>

        <dd>optional field, showing the time spent on the case status change</dd>

        <dt><strong>Conclusion</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          the conclusion, with which the previous status has finished. You can select one of the following values:

          <ul>
            <li>no conclusion (e.g. the case is suspended, closed, deletec, etc.)</li>

            <li>guilty</li>

            <li>not guilty</li>

            <li>cessation</li>
