  <p>As the case evolves, new activities related to the case should be recorded into the system: consultations with the adverso, research, traveling, etc. The activities for each case will help to analyse and report how time is spent for your cases.</p>

  <p><b>In order to add a follow-up to a case</b>, follow the steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Select a case from the &#8220;My cases&#8221; (accessible by clicking on &#8220;Cases&#8221; from the main menu).</li>

    <li>Click on the &#8220;Follow-ups&#8221; tab in order to open the list of existing follow-ups (done activities) within the current case.</li>

    <li>Click the button &#8220;New follow-up&#8221;.</li>

    <li>Fill in the form &#8220;New follow-up&#8221;, containing the following fields:
