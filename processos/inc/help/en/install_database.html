  <p>This step consists of entering the necessary information for the connection of LCM to the SQL database server.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Database address: this information should be “localhost”, but it could also be your site’s address (“www.mysite.cliente”) depending on the configuration of the server.</li>

    <li>Connection login: it is often the same login you use to upload your files by FTP or SSH.</li>

    <li>Connection password: it is often the same password as the one you use to access your site by FTP or SSH.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>These settings cannot be invented: not knowing them means that your host has not given them to you. Therefore: if you do not have this information at hand you cannot continue.</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you are not the server administrator: you must contact him/her directly. Some Internet hosts provide such information in an online guide or require a specific procedure for that.</li>

    <li>If you are the server administrator: you can create a database for LCM with the following commands:</li>
  </ul>
  <pre>
$ mysql -u root
mysql&gt; create database lcm;
mysql&gt; grant all on lcm.* to lcm_user@localhost identified by 'mypassword';
</pre>

  <p>In the above example, we create a database named “lcm” and later create a new user named “lcm_user” to whom we give full access to the “lcm” database.</p>

  <p>The “lcm_user” and “mypassword” will then be the connection login and connection password respectively for continuing the installation.</p>

  <p>Please note that the best way to connect to your database depends on your local server configuration.</p>
