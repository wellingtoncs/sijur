  <p>The follow-up activities for each case usually involve one or many adversos. LCM manages adversos seperately from cases, since a given adverso may be involved in one or many cases. It is therefore necessary to associate the adversos with their cases in order to quickly find the adverso's cases, the
  contacts of the adverso, etc. It is also possible to generate reports for statistical information of adversos.</p>

  <p>LCM identifies two types of adversos:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>physical persons</li>

    <li>juridical persons (clienteanisations)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Depending on the policy of your legal aid centre, juridical persons may also be associated with cases for which they are related (funding, co-defenders, etc.). It is also possible that they system administrator has completely de-activated them.</p>
