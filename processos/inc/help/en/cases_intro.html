  <h3><a name="SECTION03112000000000000000" id="SECTION03112000000000000000"></a>New case</h3>

  <p><b>In order to open a new case in the system</b>, follow the steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Click on the button &#8220;Cases&#8221; from the main navigation menu and then on the &#8220;Open a new case&#8221; button located in the central part of the screen, under the list of cases.</li>

    <li>The form &#8220;New case&#8221; will open, with the following elements:

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Title of the case</strong></dt>

        <dd>Enter a short but descriptive title of the case, which will help to you and your colleagues to distinguish it easily among the others. Mandatory field.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Assignement date</strong></dt>

        <dd>Shows the moment, from which the case has been assigned and work on it has been started. This field is useful for the cases in which you have worked on the case (e.g. on paper) and later on it has been filled in the system. By default, the value of this field is the date of creation of
        the case.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Legal reason</strong></dt>

        <dd>optional field, in which usually is filled in the normative act, article and paragraph number, according to which a breach has been done. This field may be de-activated by the site administrator, according to the requirements of your office.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Notes</strong></dt>

        <dd>optional field, free text.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Status of the case</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          in the beginning status, there are two possibilities:

          <ul>
            <li>draft - the case is not yet opened officially to work on it</li>

            <li>open - work has been started on the case or the case has been assigned to certain user of the system</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Stage</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          optional field, you can fill it in, if the case has relation to a case with certain state in the current legal system of the court:

          <ul>
            <li>first</li>

            <li>second</li>

            <li>third</li>

            <li>fourth</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Office collaboration and confidentiality</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          here you can control whether your colleagues (the other users) can review and/or fill in date for the certain case or not. Both existing fields are:

          <ul>
            <li>Other users can consult this case. (i.e. they can read the case, but not to modify the data related to it)</li>

            <li>Other users can contribute to this case. (i.e. they can as well read, as modify data related to the case)</li>
          </ul>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p><b>NB!</b> The default values of both fields and the possibility to change them depends on the office policy regarding the system, defined by the administrator of your clienteanisation.</p>

      <p>The page can contain additional fields and keywords in relation to the settings, made by the administrator of your clienteanisation.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Click on the &#8220;Validate&#8221; button in order to save the form.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>After successfully registering your case in the system, you will see the page called: &#8220;Case details&#8221;, showing the newly registered case, with its newly appropriated case ID. This page gives the general information, the follow-ups, the agenda, the reports and the attached documents related to
  this case, as well as a possibility to go back for editing it.</p>
