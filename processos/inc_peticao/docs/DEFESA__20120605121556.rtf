Atrav\'e9s deste reconheceram dever a import\'e2ncia de R$ 43.058,15 (quarenta e tr\'eas mil e cinquenta e oito reais e quinze centavos), que deveria ser originalmente pago em 36 (trinta e seis) parcelas mensais e consecutivas, tal como descrito no referido contrato.\qj0 \par\qj \line A Executada anuiu com todas as cl\'e1usulas estabelecidas no contrato mencionado no par\'e1grafo anterior, comprometendo-se com a liquida\'e7\'e3o do d\'e9bito, compreendendo principal e acess\'f3rio, encargos e acr\'e9scimos, comiss\'e3o de perman\'eancia, juros morat\'f3rios, multas, honor\'e1rios advocat\'edcios, despesas e demais comina\'e7\'f5es expressas no Contrato.\qj0 \par\qj \line Entre as cl\'e1usulas dessa negocia\'e7\'e3o, o Contrato de Confiss\'e3o de D\'edvidas prev\'ea o Vencimento Antecipado da opera\'e7\'e3o, de par com sua imediata exigibilidade se, dentre outros eventos, o Executado e seu interveniente garantidor n\'e3o cumpriram com uma de suas obriga\'e7\'f5es, ou seja, a falta de pagamento de quaisquer import\'e2ncias relativas a este instrumento, nas datas em que se tornarem devidas, ou na eventualidade de vencimento antecipado do Contrato, de pleno direito e por qualquer circunst\'e2ncia, exigir-se-\'e1 a liquida\'e7\'e3o integral e imediata do total da d\'edvida e encargos devidos (do vencimento antecipado, cl\'e1usula d\'e9cima quinta).\qj0 \par\qj \line Nesse diapas\'e3o, no dia 03 de Maio de 2010, venceu-se a segunda parcela sem que tenha ocorrido seu pagamento, raz\'e3o pela qual \'e9 leg\'edtimo o direito do Exequente em reputar a d\'edvida vencida e exig\'edvel, independente de qualquer outra formalidade.\qj0 \par\qj \line Por oportuno, saliente-se que o Executado deve ao Exequente a quantia de R$ @VALOR@ (sessenta e oito reais e quinhentos e cinquenta e dois reais e quarenta e quatro centavos), conforme atesta planilha de d\'e9bito (demonstrativo de ajuizamento) que segue anexo (doc. 03).\qj0 \par\qj \line Todavia, apesar dos esfor\'e7os empreendidos pelo Exequente no sentido do recebimento de seus cr\'e9ditos pelos meios amig\'e1veis, o mesmo n\'e3o conseguiu lograr \'eaxito, logo, n\'e3o restou outra alternativa sen\'e3o o ajuizamento da presente execu\'e7\'e3o fundada em t\'edtulo extrajudicial l\'edquido, certo e exig\'edvel.\qj0 \par\qj  \qj0
